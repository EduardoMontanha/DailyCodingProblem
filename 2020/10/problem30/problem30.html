                <p>This problem was asked by <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional
                    elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height.
                    Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1)
                    space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, given the input <code>[2, 1, 2]</code>, we can hold 1 unit of water
                    in the middle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given the input <code>[3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]</code>, we can hold 3 units in the first
                    index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would
                    run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.
                </p>
