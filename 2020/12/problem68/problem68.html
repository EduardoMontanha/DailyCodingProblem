                <h1>Problem #68</h1>

                <p>This problem was asked by <strong>Google</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    On our special chessboard, two bishops attack each other if they share the same diagonal.
                    This includes bishops that have another bishop located between them, i.e. bishops can
                    attack through pieces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You are given <code>N</code> bishops, represented as (row, column) tuples on a <code>M</code>
                    by <code>M</code> chessboard. Write a function to count the number of pairs of bishops that
                    attack each other. The ordering of the pair doesn't matter: (1, 2) is considered the same as
                    (2, 1).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, given <code>M = 5</code> and the list of bishops:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>(0, 0)</li>
                    <li>(1, 2)</li>
                    <li>(2, 2)</li>
                    <li>(4, 0)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The board would look like this:
                </p>

                <code class="code-block">
                    <pre>
                        [b 0 0 0 0]
                        [0 0 b 0 0]
                        [0 0 b 0 0]
                        [0 0 0 0 0]
                        [b 0 0 0 0]</pre>
                </code>

                <p>
                    You should return <code>2</code>, since bishops 1 and 3 attack each other, as well as bishops
                    3 and 4.
