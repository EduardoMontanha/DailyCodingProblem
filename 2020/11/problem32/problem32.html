                <p>This problem was asked by <strong>Jane Street</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D
                    array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there
                    is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount
                    <code>A</code> of any currency, so that you can end up with some amount
                    greater than <code>A</code> of that currency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.
                </p>
