                <h1>Problem #34</h1>

                <p>This problem was asked by <strong>Quora</strong>.</p>
                <p>
                    Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the
                    fewest number of characters as possible anywhere in the word. If there
                    is more than one palindrome of minimum length that can be made, return
                    the lexicographically earliest one (the first one alphabetically).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, given the string <code>race</code>, you should return
                    <code>ecarace</code>, since we can add three letters to it (which is
                    the smallest amount to make a palindrome). There are seven other
                    palindromes that can be made from <code>race</code> by adding three
                    letters, but <code>ecarace</code> comes first alphabetically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As another example, given the string <code>google</code>, you should
                    return <code>elgoogle</code>.
