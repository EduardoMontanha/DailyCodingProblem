                <p>
                    Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order,
                    write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and
                    selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, given <code>[9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]</code>, you should return <code>5</code>, since
                    you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.
